# Algorithms

We love pull requests from everyone. This repository is created for you to contribute different algorithms in different languages. There are separate folders for different languages.

## Contributor Guide

First fork the repository and then clone it using:


```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/algorithms.git
```
You may contribute with any of the following:-
* Implement an algorithm which is not present in a particular language's folder.
* Optimizing or improving an existing algorithm.
* Adding a different approach for an existing algorithm.
* Finding and fixing bugs.


### Pull Requests
- Add your file in the particular language's folder and make sure you name it properly. The name of the Algorithm has to be in PascalCase(First letter of every word has to be capital, without any spaces).
- Update [README.md](https://github.com/manishdangi98/algorithms/blob/master/README.md) with the name of the algorithm in the particular language's section.
